The brand was created in 1928 by the Hoberg Paper Company in Green Bay, Wisconsin . In 1950, the name was changed to Charmin Paper Company and produced bath tissue, paper napkins, among other paper products. Procter  Gamble acquired Charmin Paper Company in 1957. Charmin Ultra Soft is the brand’s highest-selling product by revenue. The product itself posts a soft toilet paper in a long-lasting roll while being two times more absorbent. The toilet tissue is clog-safe, and septic-safe, as well as Roto-Rooter plumber  approved, coming complete with a guarantee from Charmin. However, in February 2009, Greenpeace, a non-governmental environmental agency, advised against using Charmin toilet paper, stating it was bad for the environment. By 2018, Charmin became certified by the Forest Stewardship Council and the Rainforest Alliance. However, the company has still seen its share of controversies as it relates to the environment. ',\n 'Charmin Ultra Strong. Mehoopany, Pennsylvania  Annual Revenue: $1 billion The Charmin brand is owned by consumer goods giant Procter  Gamble . The brand was created in 1928 by the Hoberg Paper Company in Green Bay, Wisconsin . Charmin first began with a few different mascots before finally landing on “The Charmin Bear,” which D’Arcy Masius Benton  Bowels created in Britain. He was introduced to the United States in 2000. The following year, Charmin added three cubs to the family and, in 2007, had a blue bear for their soft brands and a red bear for their strong brands. Today, “The Charmin Bears have five family members each, with the five red bears dubbed the “Charmin Ultra Strong Family.” Charmin Ultra Strong has a diamond weave texture and is touted as a cleaner  toilet paper. It is Charmin’s strongest 2-ply toilet paper and, like Charmin Ultra Soft, is clog-safe, septic-safe, and Roto-Rooter plumber approved.
